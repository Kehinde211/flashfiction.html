																								<p><i>Only if I could turn back the tides of time and change it. Only if there was a time machine. The deed had been done and this time had dealt me a fatal and irreparable blow. I thought I had seen this film before but I liked that ending. The Harley Quinn science fictional novels I often read at my leisure hours kept replaying in my memory. Better still, I felt like I was in one of those VR headsets watching Marvel’s latest blockbuster movie, Avengers Endgame that screened last week. Of course, everyone did like the ending. Only that this was my own endgame. All I had to do was be successful and prosperous. They say money solves every problem, don’t they? Those thoughts kept ravaging and spreading in my head like wildfire in the wilderness and I wished they stopped. They were my cross to carry. Only if this time, I was Jesus who died for everyone’s sins. Whose sins was I dying for? Driiiiin Driiiiin, my alarm rang. There I lay, in my sweaty soaked bedsheet. Just die, Vincent, die, I screamed as I smashed the alarm in exasperation. Only if the poor little alarm could speak. My onlys were endless.</i></p>

																								<p><i>Sade and I smiled as we exchanged I dos on our engagement day. The myriad of I love you, the unending midnight calls, the romantic dinners and dates were finally worth it. The proposal was the icing on the cake as we were the cynosure of eyes and everyone kept cheering her on screaming say yes, yes, yes. She finally said yes, meekly. Some crow cawed loudly on the terrace. Well, did I ever believe in bad omens anyways? Was this a sign? It was the best day of my life. Friends, family, everyone envied and wanted to be like us. We made beautiful plans; how we would spend all day in bed, our preference about our kid’s genders and names, our relocation plans to the UK. I remember it all too well. The major highlight was the eve of our wedding. I called Sade that night, told her I wanted her to be my woman and the mother of my children.</i></p>

																								<p><i>Our marriage was blessed with twins and we felt on top of the world. Frances and Freddie were here! We were parents! Unfortunately, fate had newer plans for me. It started with the twins’s pulsating headaches and mild fevers. We would often rush them to the hospital but they never completely healed. This took a huge toll on me as I took to drinking and lost focus at work. My mind would often wander around till it became conspicuous and a fuss among my colleagues. I was fired!</i></p>

																								<p><i>The excruciating tears and sobs of my wife jeered me back to the world of the living on an early Friday morning. Freddie and Frances were dead!, she wept. Tears flowed down my eyes as I sank to the earth and wished it would open up and swallow me. Who did this to us? My discernment of the crow on the window seemed to accelerate my suspicion. It was the second time. Was this indeed a bad omen? Or was I cursed?</i></p>

																								<p><i>That gloomy night flushed in reminiscences as I remembered our courting days. We were very much in love that the adrenaline rush for marriage clouded our morality till we started exchanging photos that bared our bodies. Unfortunately, one of her chat buddies had the popular GB WhatsApp feature that couldn’t delete sent messages. She mistakenly sent them to him! Sade couldn’t bear to tell me because she didn’t want to lose me. It was the beginning of our doom.</i></p>

																								<p><i>My wife was undeniably all I you ever wanted in a woman. A pretty face, an hour glass shape, name it all. In fact, she was the standard. I knew I wasn’t the only admirer as I got really lucky. Who wanted to ruin this happiness? I had to wake the Sherlock Holmes in me.</i></p>

																								<section>
																								<p><i>My suspicions arose as I dug through my wife’s iPhone. Of course, she was the social type and always had to parade her culinary skills on Instagram. My suspicions deepened as I combed through and found menacing chats with her and one Dr Daniel. Sooner, the puzzles began to match. Our usual appointments at St. Anne’s Hospital; my wife’s insistence on St. Anne’s. Was the doctor sleeping with my wife.</i></p>
																								</section>
																								<section>
																								<p><i>My boiling rage escalated as I barged into the doctor’s hospital looking for answers. So you’ve been sleeping with my wife? I challenged the doctor with clenching fists ready to hand him a blow. My hopes were dashed as he firmly swore against my accusations. I was confused.</i></p>

																								<p><i>Sade was next and she had to confess, else I would kill her. I opened my mouth in shock as she confessed the laboratory scientist at St. Anne’s was her colleague in university and had been threatening her with her nude pictures. I couldn’t do nothing. After all, she really had less part of the blame.</i></p>

																								<p><i>You deserve nothing less than death, you bastard! I exclaimed in fury as I barged into St. Anne’s Hospital looking for him. Pitifully, he confessed to doing them. He also confessed to injecting damaging serums into our kids system while we brought them to the hospital. Fortunately, heaven heard and answered my wishes as I heard a deafening gunshot and watched as him drop down, dead in front of me. I slowly turned my head to catch a glimpse of my God’s sent and behold, it was Sade. Nooooo, I howled. She had been eavesdropping all along. I watched helplessly as the cops cuffed and bundled her into their van. She was our sacrificial lamb. We were our Judas. It boomeranged.</i></p>
